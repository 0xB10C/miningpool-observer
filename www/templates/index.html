          Transparency for Mining Pool Transaction Selection
        </h2>

        <p>
            Bitcoin Mining Pools construct blocks from unconfirmed transactions.
            While the general approach is to maximize fee revenue by picking the transactions paying the highest fee per byte,
            pools can decide which transaction to include and which to leave out.
            The transaction selection can, for example, be influenced by out-of-band payments, pool operator preferences, and regulatory requirements.

            Bitcoin Core offers a <dfn>Remote Procedure Call</dfn> (<abbr>RPC</abbr>) named <code>getblocktemplate</code> which returns
            a so-called block template.
            This block template contains the set of unconfirmed transactions known to the node paying the highest fee per byte.

            By comparing the templates and final blocks, differences can be highlighted.

            The methodology is explained in the <a href="{{CONFIG.base_url}}/faq#methodology">FAQ</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bitcoin is designed to have a high censorship resistance.
          In a scenario where most mining pools choose to filter a transaction, a single mining pool including the transaction in their block is enough to make sure that it confirms eventually.
          In another, more extreme scenario a consortium of mining pools could decide to ignore blocks with certain <i>unwanted</i> transactions.
          While this would require a prolonged hashrate majority (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Majority_attack">Bitcoin Wiki: Majority-Attack or 51%-Attack</a>) to be successful, it would effectively overcome Bitcoins censorship resistance.
          This tool can deliver the observations for detecting pool-level censorship by transaction-filtering, but it is not capable of detecting hashrate-majority attacks.
