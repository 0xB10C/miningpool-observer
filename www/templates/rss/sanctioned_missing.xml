          The block template includes {{ block.sanctioned_missing_tx }} sanctioned transaction{{ block.sanctioned_missing_tx | pluralize }}, which {{ block.sanctioned_missing_tx | pluralize(singular="is", plural="are") }} missing from the block mined by {{ block.pool_name }}.

          {{ block.pool_name }} does not necessarily filter transactions based on US sanction programs.
          Transactions can be missing from blocks for multiple reasons, including bad propagation or conflicts with other unconfirmed transactions.
          However, the likelihood that {{ block.pool_name }} filters sanctioned transactions increases when sanctioned transactions are repeatedly missing from blocks mined by {{ block.pool_name }}.
