        Two Bitcoin transactions conflict, when they use the same <dfn>Unspent Transaction Output</dfn> (<abbr>UTXO</abbr>).
        This page lists the conflicts between templates and blocks.

        However, this page only lists a subset of the conflicting transactions present in the Bitcoin network.
        There can still exist conflicting transactions in the network unknown to both the mining pool and the node powering this site.

        <strong>Note</strong>: Usually, many of the conflicting transactions listed below are not properly propagated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki">BIP-125 (Opt-in Full Replace-by-Fee Signaling)</a> replacement transactions.
